# Cat and Dog Classifier

This is a simple cat and dog classifier built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. The classifier is designed to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to train a basic image classifier using TensorFlow. By providing a set of labeled cat and dog images, the model learns to differentiate between the two categories.

The classifier is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN), a powerful architecture commonly used for image classification tasks. The CNN consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction and pooling layers for spatial downsampling. The extracted features are then flattened and fed into fully connected layers for classification.

## Dataset

To train and evaluate the classifier, a dataset of cat and dog images was used. The dataset is not included in this repository, but it can be easily obtained from various online sources or created manually by collecting cat and dog images.

It's important to note that the dataset should be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the classifier accurately. The recommended split is typically around 80% for training and 20% for testing, but it can be adjusted based on the size and complexity of the dataset.

## Dependencies

To run the classifier, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (version X.X.X)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing results)

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Obtain or create a dataset of cat and dog images.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Modify the paths and parameters in the classifier script according to your dataset.
5. Run the classifier script:

```shell
python classifier.py
```

6. The script will train the classifier on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.
7. After training, you can use the classifier to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, or datasets. The provided classifier serves as a starting point for understanding image classification using TensorFlow.
